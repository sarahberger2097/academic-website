### My Projects


*Coming soon*: {{<icon name="sistrix" pack="fab">}} **O-MINDS: Object Memorability Image Norming Database Software**
* This software contains over 1700 object images with normed data and is free for researchers to use. It is being developed to allow users to input their specifications (e.g. how memorable or emotional would you like your stimuli to be), and output groups of images that are balanced on those criteria. This will be helpful for removing the effects of stimulus variability in memory studies. Full details will be available soon on the [Duncan Lab](https://duncanlab.org) website.
